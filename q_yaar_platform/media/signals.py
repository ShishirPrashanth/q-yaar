"""Delete the backing S3 object when an Asset row is hard-deleted.

Catches all hard-deletion paths (user CASCADE, game CASCADE, batch cleanup
of soft-deleted rows) in one place. The DB row is gone by post_delete time,
so the object_key is read from the instance before it's discarded. Deletion
is offloaded to a celery task so a slow or failing S3 call can't block or
break the delete path.

User-initiated deletes are soft (is_deleted=True) and do NOT fire this
signal; S3 cleanup for those happens when the batch job hard-deletes the
row later.
