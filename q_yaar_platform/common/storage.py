"""
S3-compatible object storage driver (Deuxfleurs/Garage, MinIO, AWS S3, ...).

Thin, synchronous wrapper over the minio client. This is the lowest layer:
the media service talks to it, the API layer never does.

This module is stateless: `build_s3_client()` constructs a fresh client from
explicit config and caches nothing — the driver never reads Django settings,
so any caller passes its full S3 config. Callers own the returned client and
reuse it across operations to keep the underlying connection pool warm.
Object keys are built from parts joined by "/":

    {bucket}/{file_id}

so every object for a bucket lives under a single prefix.
